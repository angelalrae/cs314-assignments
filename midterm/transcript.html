            Hi, my name is Angela and I am the Digital Design Architect for this website. I am currently a sophomore majoring in Computer Science and Computational Thinking, with a concentration in Environmental Studies.</br>
            </br>I didn’t have any experience in web design when I applied, but I’ve been involved in dance and orchestra here at Gonzaga and was excited about the opportunity to help build the website and apply the computer skills I'd learned in the classroom.
            I’d also worked with Suzanne before, as a dancer in the opera Dido and Aeneas, which she directed and choreographed in 2016.</br>
            </br>One of the things that attracted me to both Gonzaga and this position is the opportunity to connect technology and the arts. In the Computer Science and Computational Thinking program, I am able to pursue my interests in programming, as well
            as environmentalism. Similarly, in my position with the Digital Humanities Initiative, I get to explore the intersection of computing, dance, and theatre. </br>
            </br>As the Digital Design Architect, I am primarily in charge of the structure and layout of the website. I take the written and visual content from Suzanne, Janine, and Elise, and I make it look as good as possible on the Omeka site. One of the
            biggest challenges of this project is making the website work for the wide variety of viewers that will visit it. We want the site to be scholarly and thoroughly cited for academic audiences, as well as artistic and beautiful for dance and
            theatre audiences, while keeping everything dynamic to accommodate expansion of the project beyond Gonzaga and the Spokane community.</br>
            </br>It has been an honor to work on this project. I’ve seen the show twice now and I’ve been immersed in the text that Suzanne wrote while putting together the site, and I find that the production and the website keep connecting to little parts
            of my life. Growing up, the church my family attended was like a second home to me, and hearing these stories from scripture reminds me of the love in that community. Working on the Community Resources section of the website allowed me to
            reconnect with a friend I’d lost touch with, who’s developing a project providing resources to victims of sexual assault. I also gained confidence in myself as a computer scientist, after feeling discouraged in the classroom and thinking the
            field might not be for me. And I’ve been inspired to try to build a different website for another project I’m a part of on campus.</br>
            </br>It has been a blessing for me to be a part of this project, and I hope you find something here that you can take with you into your life.
